### Executing the Program
Upon launching the program, users will encounter a login screen, requiring a valid username and password that corresponds to information stored in a MySQL database. This program necessitates Java 11 and has not been assessed with other JVMs.

### Supplementary Report
For the customized report, I opted to showcase the number of appointments per country. SQL was employed to perform all tasks, resulting in a query that merges three tables and outputs two columns (Country and count). Although the query is intricate, it simplified the Java side, allowing the data to be easily displayed in a table view format.
